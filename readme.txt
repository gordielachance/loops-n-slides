A simple yet powerful plugin that allows you to build custom posts loops and load them using a shortcode; eventually as a carousel of slides.
Optionally, it will convert your existing galleries to carousels.

= Features =
* **Sky is the limit !** Create a loop that will display exactly the posts you want; filtered by tag, category, by post author... any Wordpress Query works !
* **Loop templates:** You can choose among several templates to display your loop, or **create your own** !
* **Carousels:** The plugin is shipped with [OwlCarousel](https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/).  Just click the *Carousel Checkbox* when editing a loop, it will be displayed in a nice, slidy way.  You can define global options for the carousels, or/and define them for each loop.
* **Shortcode: ** Once a loop has been created, you can embed it in a posts with a simple shortcode: `[loops-n-slides id=XXX]`
* **Carousel galleries:** Optionally, enable carousels for your existing Wordpress galleries, globally or for each gallery.

This one IS totally free.  But if you like it, if you use it, please consider [making a donation](http://bit.ly/gbreant).
This would be very appreciated â€” Thanks !

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I use custom templates to render my loops? =

Create a directory `loopsns` in your active theme.
Create your [custom page templates](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/page-template-files/#creating-custom-page-templates-for-global-use) in that directory.  They should have a specific opening PHP tag:
`<?php /* Loops 'n Slides Loop: My Custom Loop Template Title */ ?>`

See the files under *loops-n-slides/templates* for examples.
You can override those default files by have custom files that have the same filename in your `loopsns` directory.

= How can I use the plugin to display an existing Wordpress gallery as a carousel? =

You can either enable this option by default for all your galleries (see the Loops 'n Slides Settings page); or enable it for a few galleries only, by adding the attribute `loopsns-carousel=1` to your existing shortcode.
Example : `[gallery ids="113,117" loopsns-carousel=1]`

When enabled globally, you can prevent a gallery from rendering as a carousel by adding the attribute `loopsns-carousel=0`.
